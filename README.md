# NAND2Te #

[Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/) component for implementing a
HACK-like computer as described in the [From NAND to Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org) course.

## How do I get set up? ##

The easiest way to build the necessary Jar is to use [maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

* JDK 1.8 is needed (either the Oracle JDK 1.8 or OpenJDK 1.8)
* Clone the repository.
* Replace the `Digital.jar` which is included in this repo with the version you want to use.
* After that run `mvn package` to create the library jar file
